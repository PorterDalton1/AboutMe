            <h2>This Poem I Wrote</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Inspired by my hunger and just enough creativity to pump out a poem for a class. <br><br>
            <center>
            <i>
            There is an old man from vermont, <br>
            He takes time eating baked fresh croissants, <br>
            Till one day his maid, <br>
            Give him lemonade, <br>
            Now he eats them while making word fonts. <br>
            </i>

            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            I'm an avid hiker and a major outdoor enthusiast. I take my dog, a brittany spaniel. on many of the hikes I go on. 
            My personal favorite hike is Timpanogos and I try to make time for it every year. I have plans for King's Peak eventually as well as Lone Peak.
            My favorite place in Utah that few people know about is Survey Lake next to East Granddaddy Mountain. My cousin and I go
            camping down there every year. It's a bit of a hike to get to get to the lake but once you've made the trek, it's complete solitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also a big tennis player. I am currently competing at NTRP 4.5 Leagues, which is a very standard . I teach casually mainly for beginners and kids. 
            I began playing when my dad took me out when I was about 10. I was entirely coached by my father. My main partner right now has undergone foot
            surgery and is needing about 6 months of recovery. So lately I haven't been getting out as much. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly I love science fiction. Especially the old retro-futuristic stuff. As a kid I read H.G. Wells's <i>The Time Machine</i> and Jeanne DuPrau's 
            <i>The City of Ember</i> and absolutely fell in love with the genre. I think the reason I like it so much is it takes on ideas of the unknown and 
            clashes it with existential questions about mankind and the unforgiving nature of the forces of the universe.
